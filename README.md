
# Yet another pomodoro app?

Normal Pomodoro timers are too easy to ignore. This app makes skipping a break a little more difficult (but not too difficult, since sometimes you really can't take a break instantly).

Work mode: customizible always-on-top draggable timer progress bar, not distracting you from work.

Hidden control panel: hover on timer progress bar to show control panel (with 300ms cooldown).

Settings window: click Settings button on control panel to change timers or appearance of progressbar / rest screen.

Rest screen: always-on-top fullscreen window that allow you to skip timer with entering skip phrase (skipped time would be added to next rest).
